My code for https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-modeling and https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-modeling - both of which I highly recommend.

Don't copy these for the course - you won't learn anything if you don't problem solve yourself. I upload them because:
1. Solutions are already extremely widespread.
2. I'm quite proud of mine.
3. It might be useful resume fodder.
